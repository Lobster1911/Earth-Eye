Final Year Project 

This is the complete Satellite Tracking and Trajectory Prediction Application 

I have attached both Frontend and Backend 

Step 1 Run the ProxyandRequest.py for Backend 
Step 2 go to terminal >  cd Frontend/satellitefront > npm start  
(example - PS D:\Satellite Tracking and Trajectory Prediction Web - Application> cd Frontend/satellitefront)
   
---it will take time to run as a application is big---

Step 3: It should auto launch the browser 

we are using  localhost:3000 port for the application
